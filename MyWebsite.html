		<p> I am passionate about video games. Video games are fun and keep me amused for a long time because theres always something new to do and theres always something new to play and learn. Video games are competitve depending on what you play, although they are competitive,games will always be a way to learn and not only learn but have fun. Having fun is the best way to learn. One of my favorite games to play is Overwatch.
